Last Updated: 6/3/18 
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF TOKEN SALE (THE “TERMS”) CAREFULLY. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR PURCHASE OF TOKENS DURING THE SALE PERIOD AND YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF OUR WEBSITE OR “PLATFORM,” MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND ANY OTHER ONLINE SERVICES (“SERVICES,” AS DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED BY THE CREDITCOIN FOUNDATION OR ITS LEGAL AFFILIATES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENT, FUNCTIONALITY, FEATURES AND APPLICATIONS OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES TO YOU AS A GUEST. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT PURCHASE TOKENS OR USE THE SERVICES. IF YOU VIOLATE THESE TERMS IN ANY MANNER, YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES SHALL BE TERMINATED. 
YOU AGREE AND CERTIFY THAT, IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURCHASE TOKENS DURING THE TOKEN SALE, YOU WILL PURCHASE TOKENS ONLY FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL USE AND UTILITY, TO PARTICIPATE ON THE PLATFORM AND NOT FOR INVESTMENT, DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER FINANCIAL PURPOSES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TOKENS ARE NOT A SECURITY AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TOKENS MAY LOSE ALL VALUE. Tokens are a cryptographic token to be used on the Flatlay and Creditcoin platforms. If you do not understand any of the concepts outlined in the White Paper, these Terms, the Platform Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy or in any other Terms and Policies, please contact us at support@theflatlay.com. By agreeing to these Terms you affirm that you understand and agree with all concepts described in the above-specified documents to your satisfaction. 
Your purchase of Ethereum-based Creditcoin (“CCOIN”) tokens (referred to herein as “CCOIN Tokens” or “Tokens”) during the Token sale period (comprised of the Public Presale Period, the Invitation- Only Presale Period and the Public Sale Period, as defined in these Terms governing the sale of CCOIN Tokens and collectively referred to as the “Sale Period”) from Creditcoin Foundation, a Cayman Island entity (“CCOIN,” “ we,” “us,” “our”), is subject to these Terms (as amended and as provided herein, “Terms”). Each of you and CCOIN is a “Party,” and together the “Parties.” 
These Terms take effect when you (1) click an “I Agree” button, check box or other indicator of agreement presented with these Terms or, (2) through your use of the Services, such as by interacting with our website, and they may be altered from time to time as provided herein, at our sole discretion. By purchasing Tokens from us during the Sale Period or by using the Services, you will be bound by these Terms and all terms incorporated by reference. If you have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact us at support@theflatlay.com. 
Please see our Privacy Policy, located at https://flat-lay.com/privacy for information and disclosures relating to the collection and use of your Personal Information on Flatlay, as defined therein, and any other data in connection with your use of the Services. The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms. 
 
These Terms, our Privacy Policy https://flat-lay.com/privacy and the Terms of Use https://flat-lay.com/terms govern your use of and access to the Services (collectively, the “Terms and Policies”). 




You and CCOIN agree as follows: 
1. Purpose and Use of Tokens 
The Tokens will be sold to eligible Token purchasers during the Sale Period only. It is in CCOIN’s sole discretion to decide whether or not a potential purchaser will be eligible to purchase Tokens. 
The purpose of the Tokens is to facilitate your use of the Services, including your ability to purchase and use Creditcoin tokens in a decentralized, global peer-to-peer marketplace and obtain other information via the Platform and Services allowing contributions and access to the Flatlay platform, website, data, mobile applications and any other services (collectively, the “Services”). Specifically, Tokens are intended to be used on the Flatlay and Creditcoin platform (“Platform”) to facilitate the global shift to a token based affiliate and content marketing network. Important additional details regarding the Services and our purpose are in the White Paper. The information contained in the White Paper and on www.cointoken.io is of a descriptive nature only, is not binding and – unless explicitly referred to herein – does not form part of these Terms. 
The Creditcoin Platform may be operated and maintained by third parties. As we have no ability to control third parties’ use of the Platform, our responsibility or liability for the Platform is limited. 
The Tokens do not confer any rights other than rights relating to the provision and receipt of Services and your use of the Platform, subject to limitations and conditions in applicable Terms and Policies. 
2. Principles and Disclosures Regarding the Sale 
When purchasing Tokens, you will transfer Ether (“ETH”), Bitcoin (“ BTC”) or other cryptocurrency converted into ETH (collectively referred to hereinafter as “Cryptocurrency”) via https://Tokensale.cointoken.io to the unique Token wallet deposit address provided to you during the Sale Period (the “Wallet”). 
You understand and accept that while the individuals and entities, including the Flatlay team, assigned to this task, will make reasonable efforts to continue to further develop the Creditcoin Platform, it is possible that such development may fail and your Tokens may become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons. 
You are also aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the Platform or Services are released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the Platform or Services could be fully or partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest, regulatory or other reasons. You therefore understand and accept that the transfer of Cryptocurrency to the relevant Wallet and the creation of Tokens carry significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value of created Tokens, if any, and attributed features of the Platform and Services). 
You furthermore understand and accept that – as the creation of the Tokens as well as the assignment of the Tokens, and the execution of the Platform and Services are networked– the terms and conditions applicable thereon are set forth in the Platform code, consisting of multiple interconnected software codes, existing on the Ethereum blockchain, or other blockchain (as determined by the Creditcoin foundation) as set forth on the website: www.cointoken.io (“Platform Code”). Specifically, CCOIN reserves the right to migrate from the Ethereum protocol to a future protocol that may or may not currently exist, for any reason. Tokens issued and outstanding will be exchanged on an equal basis, if the revised protocol requires the underlying token protocol to be different from the currently utilized Ethereum protocol. To the extent the Terms contained herein or in any other document or communication contradict the ones set forth in these Terms, the Terms shall prevail. Furthermore, neither this document nor any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations to the Tokens or publisher of these Terms or developer of the Services and/or any other person, entity and/or affiliates involved with the deployment of the Services and the setting up of the Platform beyond those set forth in these Terms. 
By transferring Cryptocurrency to the relevant Wallet you expressly agree to these Terms in their entirety. You further confirm to have carefully reviewed the terms and conditions set forth in this document and to fully understand the risks and costs of creating Tokens and making a contribution of such for the development of the Platform and delivery of the Services. 
This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a share/equity offering and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. It is a description of the functionality of the Platform and Services. 
By transferring Cryptocurrency to the relevant Wallet, and/or receiving Tokens, no form of partnership, joint venture, agency or any similar relationship between you and CCOIN and/or other individuals or entities involved with the deployment of the Services and the setting up of the Platform is created. 
Your contribution to the Platform will not involve any fiat currencies and will strictly be done in Cryptocurrency. 
3. Cancellation; Refusal of Purchase Requests 
Your purchase of Tokens from us during the Sale Period is final, and there are no refunds or cancellations except (i) as may be required by applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Token purchase requests at any time in our sole discretion. 
We will provide you web-based support only, in our sole discretion, which support may include email, web forums, and knowledge-based support. We will not provide telephone or live support. Our support email is support@theflatlay.com. 
4. Token Sale Procedures and Specifications 
Contribution. 
¥	Accepted Tokens. Only CCOIN Tokens are accepted on the Platform and Services. The Platform and Services do not accept any other type of token. Other than Cryptocurrency as defined above, any other type of token or cryptocurrency sent to the contract address to purchase Tokens may not be recoverable. 

¥	Presale and Sale Periods. 
			Invitation-Only Presale Period: Cryptocurrency can be contributed to a contract address for an initial period on an invitation-only basis, beginning on January 1st 2018 and continuing until the earlier of (i) March 1st, 2018 or (ii) when 35,000,000 Tokens have been purchased (the “Invitation- Only Presale Period”). 

			Public Sale Period: Cryptocurrency can be contributed to a Wallet beginning on August 1st 2018 8AM PST and ending (i) December 31st 2018 12PM PST or upon final distribution of the last public sale token. Once the Public Sale Period ceases, CCOIN will provide you notice via email or the CCOIN Site, and no additional Cryptocurrency added to a Wallet will be credited towards Tokens. 

¥	Token Pools. During the Presale Period, a maximum amount of [70,000,000] Tokens offered for the sale periods. The amount of Tokens created during the Public Sale Period will depend primarily on the amount contributed during the Invitation Only Presale Period and Public Presale Period. 1400* Tokens will be issued per 1.00 ETH equivalent received in acceptable contributions, 14000* Tokens will be issued per 1.00 BTC equivalent received in acceptable contributions. 

*Subject to Changes in market price for ETH and BTC. The above are reference points. 
Use only the Original Smart Contracts. Only CCOIN, at https://tokensale.cointoken.io/ will issue Tokens during the Sale Period. Access to this smart contract will be available through the CCOIN Site at https://cointoken.io. To the extent that any third party website, service or smart contract offers Tokens during the Sale Period or facilitates the sale or transfer of Tokens in any way during the Sale Period or at any time up to the release of the Tokens, such third-party websites or services are, unless explicitly mentioned on the CCOIN Site not authorized by CCOIN and have no relationship in any way with CCOIN or Creditcoin Tokens, and such Tokens may be invalid. 
Transferability of Tokens During the Sale Period; Issuance Period. Any and all Tokens will not be transferable until 20 days after the Sale Period, or while technical preparations are being made for issuance as set forth on https://Cointoken.io. 

Excluded Contributions. The only acceptable payment is Cryptocurrency during the Token Sale. Any type of payment not converted through the CCOIN site, will not be accepted. [You are advised NOT to send any cryptocurrency from exchanges like Coinbase, Poloniex or Kraken. In addition, DO NOT make use of any multi-signature wallet as we will not support them and your transaction will not be accepted. By doing so your Cryptocurrency may be permanently lost, and the Tokens may not be created.] 
Delivery. After completion of the Token Sale, the account you used to purchase Tokens will be credited with the appropriate number of Tokens from the total amount of Tokens you purchased during the Token Sale (the “Resulting Distribution”). All deliveries from the Resulting Distribution will be made electronically. Deliveries will be made directly to the account, address or wallet associated with your Token purchase. 

Third Party Payment Processor. If you purchase Cryptocurrency, or acquire Cryptocurrency using a third-party payment processor (e.g., ShapeShift, YUNBI, Gatecoin), that payment processor is your agent, not ours, for the purpose of the payment and purchase. You, not we, are responsible for ensuring that we actually receive the appropriate amount of Cryptocurrency. We are not responsible for any loss of funds due to the use of a third-party payment processor. 
• Pricing: 
Tokens are only for use in connection with the Platform and Services and only constitute a transferable representation of attributed functions of the Platform and Services. 
5. Taxes 
The purchase price that you pay for Tokens is exclusive of all applicable taxes. You are responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your purchase of Tokens, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar taxes. It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. We are not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or other tax arising from your purchase of Tokens. The ownership of Creditcoin Tokens may fall under existing and/or new and unprecedented taxation laws that will erode the benefits of Creditcoin Tokens. The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. New or future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could also adversely affect us and could affect our ability to develop and/or maintain the Platform. With respect to virtual currency, the Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance through Notice 2014- 21, which describes how existing general tax principles apply to transactions using virtual currency. Such guidance may or may not assist a prospective Token purchaser or user in determining the tax characterization of Tokens. Prior to acquiring Tokens, you should consult with your own investment, legal, tax and/or accounting advisors and/or other consultants to determine the potential tax consequences of Token acquisition whether through purchase or Platform interaction. 
6. Acknowledgement and Assumption of Risks 
You acknowledge and agree that there are risks associated with purchasing Tokens, holding Tokens, and using Tokens for providing or receiving Services, as disclosed and explained in the Risk Disclosures Section 25 below. You assume these risks. If you have any questions regarding these risks, please contact us at support@theflatlay.com 
BY PURCHASING TOKENS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THESE RISKS. 
7. Scope of Terms 
Unless otherwise stated herein, these Terms govern only your use of Tokens in connection with the Services. We may add new terms or policies to these Terms in our sole discretion, and may update these Terms from time to time according to the modification procedures set forth herein. Your use of the Services constitutes your acknowledgement that you have read and understand these Terms as well as the Privacy Policy, the Risk Disclosures (set forth in these Terms) as well as the White Paper and will regularly check for updates to these documents on www.cointoken.io or any other channels we make available (the “CCOIN Site”), and will read and be bound by any updates. It is your responsibility to check these Terms and the Privacy Policy posted on the TCF Site and/or the Platform periodically so that you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. 
By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with CCOIN and meet all of the eligibility requirements in these Terms.

25. Risk Disclosures 
The purchase and use of the Creditcoin Token carries significant risk. Prior to using Creditcoin Tokens, the user should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional prior to determining whether to purchase and/or use Creditcoin Tokens. 

1.	The Creditcoin Token is intended to function as an “access” or “rewards” token that facilitates access to Flatlay & Creditcoin’s Platform and Services rather than as an investment or security. An access or utilization token is a payment required in order gain access to a service or good. It derives value by providing access to a platform which has inherent value, and potentially appreciating value. It is possible, however, that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) could characterize Creditcoin Token as an “investment contract” subject to regulation under the U.S. securities laws and regulations. If the Creditcoin Token is deemed a security under U.S. securities laws and regulations, or under the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction, Creditcoin Token will be subject to restriction on transfer in the United States and/or such other jurisdictions. Such restriction on transfer may preclude development of an active trading market for Creditcoin Tokens or planned use of the Tokens on the Platform. 
2.	Creditcoin Tokens will be stored in a wallet, which can be accessed with a password selected by the purchaser. If a purchaser of Creditcoin Tokens does not maintain an accurate record of his or her password, this may lead to the loss of Creditcoin Tokens. If a purchaser’s password protection is weak and it is cracked or otherwise obtained by a third party, this may also lead to the loss of Creditcoin Tokens. As a result, purchasers must safely store the passwords in one or more backup locations that are well separated from the primary location. Flatlay and CCOIN are not responsible for any purchaser’s loss of password or other credentials. 


3.	You recognize that some of the Services are currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. You acknowledge that any of your expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Platform and/or Services may not be met for any number of reasons. 

4.	As with other crypto-tokens, the value of the Creditcoin Token may fluctuate significantly and decline in value for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, supply and demand, overall crypto-token market conditions, political and geographical reasons, changes to laws and/or regulations in any jurisdiction, and technical reasons. 

5.	The ownership of Creditcoin Tokens may fall under existing and/or new and unprecedented taxation laws that will erode the benefits of Creditcoin Tokens. The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting requirements. New or future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could also adversely affect us and could affect our ability to develop and/or maintain the Platform. With respect to virtual currency, the Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance through Notice 2014-21, which describes how existing general tax principles apply to transactions using virtual currency. Such guidance may or may not assist a prospective Token purchaser or user in determining the tax characterization of Tokens. Prior to acquiring Tokens, you should consult with your own investment, legal, tax and/or accounting advisors and/or other consultants to determine the potential tax consequences of Token acquisition whether through purchase or Platform interaction. 

6.	There is no guarantee that other current or future solutions or technology will not render the Creditcoin Platform, Services and Tokens obsolete. Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Services, which could also result in the theft or loss of Tokens. 

8.	Creditcoin Tokens will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum blockchain may impact your ability to transfer or securely hold Creditcoin Tokens. Such impact could adversely affect the value of Creditcoin Tokens. 

9.	Third parties may bring intellectual property claims against Flatlay or CCOIN. Such claims may result in litigation and could impair Creditcoin’s operations or implementation of its business plan. 

10.	It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including without limitation, the failure of the business relationships, failure to establish relationships with cities, regional programs or other entities necessary for collaboration regarding the Services, competing intellectual property claims, or token class action claims, the Platform may no longer be a viable platform and certain Services may not be provided or Creditcoin may dissolve or may fail to launch part or all of the Services. 

11.	Crypto-tokens have been known to come under malicious attacks from hackers and criminal parties resulting in theft of tokens, which may result in massive losses. 

12.	Many crypto-tokens fluctuate in value in tandem with the market price of bitcoin and other tokens. It is possible that Creditcoin Tokens will be affected by events that cause bitcoin or other tokens to increase or decrease in value. 

13.	Regulators continue to provide guidance with respect to ambiguities in existing laws and regulations in the context of crypto-tokens. Lawmakers and regulators are also considering and may approve new laws and regulations that govern the offering of crypto-tokens. It is possible that a government or regulatory agency will pursue Flatlay or CCOIN and require it to suspend or cease its business operations, the Services and/or the Platform in light of new interpretation of existing laws or regulations, or passage of new laws and regulations. 

14.There is a risk that CCOIN, other users, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Platform or Services, or any blockchain associated with Creditcoin Tokens, interfering with the use of or causing the loss of the Services. 
15. Crypto-tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth herein, there are risks that we cannot anticipate. Risk may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variation of the risks set forth above.
